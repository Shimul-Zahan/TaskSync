# TaskSync: Collaborative Task Management for Students and Developers

## Overview
This platform is designed to empower students working on group projects or studying together. It integrates a **Kanban board** for task management, **real-time communication** through chat and video calls, and additional tools for sharing **notes, resources, and documents**. The platform also features **video/audio calls** and **screen sharing** to facilitate seamless discussions and study sessions. Students can organize their work and collaborate in real time on tasks, projects, and study materials.

The platform will be **open-source** and **free for all users** to use, contribute to, and improve. It is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for collaborative study and project management in a single, unified platform.

## Key Features

- **Admin Controls**: The admin has the ability to:
  - Add or remove members from the group.
  - Assign tasks and set deadlines.
  - Approve or reject changes made to tasks and project materials.
  - Manage overall group permissions.
  
### 9. Commenting and Highlighting System
- **Highlighting**: Users can highlight text, paragraphs, or sections in shared documents. This feature helps emphasize key points for discussion.
  - Each highlight will be tagged with the **user’s name**, indicating who made the highlight.
  
- **Commenting**: Users can leave comments directly on specific tasks, documents, or notes.
  - **Comment Threads**: Comments can have a threaded conversation, allowing students to discuss and clarify specific points.
  - **Comment Ownership**: Each comment will show the **name and profile of the commenter**, providing transparency on who made the comment.
  
- **Change Tracking**: If a member adds a comment, updates a document, or makes any changes to a task, the platform will track these actions.
  - **Version Control**: Changes to documents or tasks are tracked, with a detailed log of who made the change and when.
  - **Change Notifications**: Members will receive notifications whenever a comment or change is made on a task or document they are assigned to.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Basic **Kanban board** for task management.
- **Real-time chat** for communication.
- **Video/audio calls** and **screen sharing**.
- **File sharing** for uploading and sharing documents and notes.
- **User authentication** (sign-up/login).

- **Gamification**: Add rewards and leaderboards to motivate students.

## Similar Existing Tools

While no direct tool exists combining all the features mentioned, several tools offer partial functionality:
1. **Trello** + **Slack** + **Zoom**: Popular for task management, communication, and video calling, but lacks an integrated study-focused environment.
2. **Notion**: An all-in-one workspace, but lacks video calls and dedicated study features.
3. **Monday.com**: A project management tool with chat and task tracking, but not focused on group study.
4. **Asana**: Used for task management and team collaboration, but lacks document reading/annotation or real-time study features.
5. **Miro** + **Google Docs**: For brainstorming and document sharing, but lacks task management or video calls.

## Why This Idea is Unique
- **Dedicated to Group Study**: The platform focuses specifically on **group study** and project collaboration, rather than general project management.
- **All-in-One Collaboration**: Combining **Kanban boards**, **chat**, **video calls**, **document sharing**, and **AI-powered suggestions** within a single platform creates a seamless user experience.
- **Reading & Annotating Documents**: Unlike most project management tools, this platform allows students to **read**, **annotate**, and **discuss** study materials directly within the platform.
- **AI-Powered Task Management**: The AI feature can intelligently suggest task distribution based on team members’ strengths and workloads.
- **Admin Controls & Change Tracking**: The **Group Admin** can manage the group, and the **commenting/highlighting system** ensures transparency and accountability for every contribution.
